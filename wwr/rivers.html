                        the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with

                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is 
                        one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free 
                        flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early 
                        summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
                        good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim 
                        tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate 
                        land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river 
                        and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and 
                        great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from 
                        from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and 
                        boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence 
                        of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater 
                        opportunities.

                        trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking 
                        scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is 
                        filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons 
                        and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. 
                        The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to 
                        accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
                        However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river 
                        rating scale, so we often refer to both.
