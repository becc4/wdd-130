                <p>I want a way to showcase my work for potential employers as 
                    well as record my progress in my studies. To do this, I will 
                    create a resume website that contains personal projects and 
                    major school assignments related to computer science. It will 
                    be itself an example of my skill sets. As I get better and 
                    work on more projects, I will be able to add to it. This 
                    was a method recommended to me by professionals in computer 
                    science as a resume but also to encourage personal projects.</p>

                <p>
                    I have goals to succeed in life, and thus in a career. Programming 
                    has provided that as a study that fills in all the gaps. I have 
                    always been logic-minded. Learning to program taught me how to 
                    continue practicing the logic-based skills required in high school, 
                    allowing me to enjoy them in my college studies and in my adult 
                    career. I find joy in solving problems and I have found a career 
                    path that involves just that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I still do not have firm plans on what I will do in my adult career, 
                    and upon the advice of professors, this study is very fluid and has 
                    intersections between its many paths. I am currently set on becoming 
                    a software developer, with most of the professional people Iâ€™ve spoken 
                    to working as one.
