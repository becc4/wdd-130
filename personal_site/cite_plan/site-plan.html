      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want a way to showcase my work for potential employers as well 
        as record my progress in my studies. To do this, I will create a 
        resume website that contains personal projects and major school 
        assignments related to computer science. It will be itself an 
        example of my skill sets. As I get better and work on more projects, 
        I will be able to add to it. This was a method recommended to me by 
        professionals in computer science as a resume but also to encourage 
        personal projects.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is mostly for me. It is a place I can keep my work and 
        accomplishments, something to work to contribute to. Others who may 
        enjoy this are friends and family who are curious about what I am 
        working on and learning. The audience I will be catering to, however, 
        are potential employers. This website portfolio will be a way for them 
        to see what I am capable of to detailed, greater length than a resume.

        Career Objectives
        I have goals to succeed in life, and thus in a career. Programming 
        has provided that as a study that fills in all the gaps. I have always 
        been logic-minded. Learning to program taught me how to continue 
        practicing the logic-based skills required in high school, allowing me 
        to enjoy them in my college studies and in my adult career. I find joy 
        in solving problems and I have found a career path that involves just that.
        I still do not have firm plans on what I will do in my adult career, and 
        upon the advice of professors, this study is very fluid and has 
        intersections between its many paths. I am currently set on becoming a 
        software developer, with most of the professional people I’ve spoken to 
        working as one.

        Mission Statement
        My career objectives, alongside doing programming in a work-setting, is 
        to be an influence. I grew up in a district that prided themselves on 
        teaching new fields like programming. I had attended many classes from 
        middle school up about basic programming, classes designed more to get 
        students interested than to teach foundational skills. However, it was 
        only when I had a female instructor in a college course teaching programming 
        did I finally realize that it was something I had wanted to do. I knew I 
        could be good at it if I tried, but there was some subconscious block that 
        told me women weren’t allowed to be programmers, somehow made worse by field 
        trips to museums to learn about women in STEM. They made it seem unordinary 
        and unnatural which could only be reversed by seeing actual women in STEM, 
        existing and enjoying their chosen study. I want to be a visible example to 
        girls that it is not unusual to be a female programmer. It is a field to be 
        enjoyed by women if they can find joy in it.

        About Me
        Societies
        I am a current member in the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) at Brigham Young 
        University - Idaho (BYU-I). There, I have participated in school-hosted and 
        society-hosted Hack-A-Thons where I collaborated with team members and exponded 
        my learning, particularly in Computer Systems which helped me for my class in it 
        this semester.

        Hobbies
        I enjoy writing and have for seven years. This has led me to minor in English, 
        and has exposed me to a variety of ideas that have challenged and strengthened 
        my own. I practice argumentative writing, using different critical theories to 
        analyze literature both for class and during my freetime. I also like creative 
        writing, practicing it for seven years. I was a part of my high school’s Poetry 
        Club and enjoy writing poetry, but my biggest strength is prose work. My 
        logic-based mind has helped my writing become more structured which has made me 
        a better planned story-teller.

      <h3>Page 2: Python</h3>
      <p>
        History
        I started learning Python in 2020 during a summer semester 
        course at Green River College. Since then, I have taken 
        several programming courses at Brigham Young University - 
        Idaho (BYU-I) that are taught in Python. In my free time, I 
        have earned a certificate from Python Institute (Entry-Level) 
        and plan to earn another one (Associate) to better qualify 
        for internships as I am working on my Computer Programming 
        certificate at BYU-I.

      <h3>Page 3: HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        History
        I started learning HTML and CSS in 2022 at Brigham Young University 
        - Idaho (BYU-I) in a Web Fundamentals (WDD130) course. I am currently 
        working on websites in this course including one course-directed 
        website (DryOar) and one self-directed website (Becca Resume). While 
        I hope to finish DryOar at the end of this semester, I have plans to 
        continue my Resume website as I continue my studies in Computer Science 
        to record my progress.
