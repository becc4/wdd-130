        Hello! I am a Computer Science major that minors in English. I transferred from a local college in Washington where I’m from so while I’ve only been here two semesters I have an Associates Degree as well. However, I only recently made the decision to study Computer Science so I expect to be here longer than anticipated. 
        I enjoy writing and caring for my plants. I have one at home, being slowly killed by my family, and an Aglaonema here which is a tropical plant so I am quite worried about killing it myself. I see this class helping me in the workplace, offering skills that would be valuable. But even if not, I would still use it for personal projects.
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life. A scripture is “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God;” [D&C 18:10].
